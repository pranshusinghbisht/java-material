Q3/- What is the difference between SOAP and REST ?

 ANS=>
       Soap means Simple object access protocol.

       Soap is one XML protocol.when we need to communicate between 
       web application and web server this soap returns the response 
       in XML format since this XML is language and platform independent.

       creating this web services using soap is very complex because 
       soap is very heavy weight application.

      So to reduce this complexity developer made one light weight,another arcitechtrual style
      "REST".

      REST full form is represantional state transfer.this style transfer the data in XML,JSON 
      format.

      REST  also create a web service and give response through http protocol and also allow 
      the client  to access with help of http protocol
