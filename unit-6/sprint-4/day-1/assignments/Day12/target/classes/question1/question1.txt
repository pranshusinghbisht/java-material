Q1/- Explain the Java-based Spring MVC architecture.


 ans:
 
 Spring MVC means model-view-controller.

     Previously there is MVC model where we use servlet class 
     in that we validate the data which comes from web application then servlet class
     gives that data to service layer to perform business logic service layer called
     the method from data access layer to perform business logic on client data for that data 
     access layer fetch data from database and gives to data access layer.
     after that service layer perform the business logic and it gives back to servlet class.
     and servlet gives it to JSP because jsp is easy to handle when there is rich UI.
     so jsp show the final data to client.

     In this Servlet works as controller because it is just controlling the flow of whole process.
     jsp work as view in this because it presents the data to client
     and model mean java bean class because in java data stores as object and we are using bean class
     to create object.

     In Spring MVC we don't need this servlet class we can directly use Spring boot framework dispatcher
     servelt class.we don't need to configure servlet class so it's gives less burden to developer.
