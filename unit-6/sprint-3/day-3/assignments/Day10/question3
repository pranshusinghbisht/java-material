Q3/- What is the difference between setter injection and constructor injection?



It may cause circular dependency It resolve the circular dependency
If the dependency is mandatory If the dependency is optional
If the dependency is "final" variable then
it must be injected through the
constructor injection only
We can not inject the final variable through the
setter
constructor injected values will be
accessible to setter method
setter injected value can not be accessible through
the constructor.
constructor injected value can not
override the setter injected value.
It can override the constructor injected value.
