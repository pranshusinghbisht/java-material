Q4/- What is auto wiring in Spring, how many types of Auto wiring are there in spring,
explain with an example.



The process of creating association between/among application components is known as "wiring".(variable is
wired with appropriate object)
We have 2 kind of wiring in spring application:
1. Explicit wiring
2. Auto-wiring (implicit wiring)
If a spring developer specifies the associations for the dependency bean by <property> tag or <constructorarg> tag, it is known as explicit wiring.
Whereas if spring container on its own detects the dependencies implicitly and injecting them into the
dependent bean is known as "auto-wiring".
To instruct the spring container to perform auto-wiring for a particular bean, we make use of the "autowire"
attribute inside the <bean> tag with any one of following values:
1. no (default)
2. byName
3. byType
4. constructor
 In bean auto-wiring, spring container automatically injects a bean dependencies by either calling a setter
method or calling parameterized constructor without writing explicitly inside the
spring configuration file.
Limitation of bean auto-wiring:
1. It can be used only to inject the objects but not the simple value dependencies.
2. If container have multiple dependencies of same type to inject , then ambiguity problem may raise.
Note: <bean> tag has "autowire" attribute and its default value is "no" . it means by default auto-wiring is
disabled in xml based auto-wiring.
Whereas in annotation based auto-wiring the default type is "byType".
1. byName:
In this strategy , if a bean id attribute value in applicationContext.xml file matches with the variable/property
name of a dependent bean, then spring container implicitly performs the setter injection into the dependent
bean , it is known as auto-wire byName
If the dependency is unmatched , container does not inject that dependency . its means property remains
with null value,
Example:
Spring Day1 19
With respect to previous dummy DAO application:
<bean id="dao" class="com.masai.daoApp.DAOBean"/>
<bean id="service" class="com.masai.daoApp.ServiceBean" autowire="byName" />
<bean id="pb" class="com.masai.daoApp.PresentationBean" autowire="byName" />
byType:
In this strategy spring container will search for a bean class in spring configuration file, that matched with the
property type.
If matched then spring container injects that dependency obj by calling the setter method of
dependent class.
If unmatched then that property will remain with null value.
Note:- if more than one bean of same type is encountered in spring configuration file ,then container
will throw "UnsatifyDependencyException"
ex:-
<bean id="db" class="com.masai.daoApp.DAOBean"/>
<bean id="sb" class="com.masai.daoApp.ServiceBean" autowire="byType" />
<bean id="pb" class="com.masai.daoApp.PresentationBean" autowire="byType" />
Here id could be anything.
example :- ambiguity error:
<bean id="db" class="com.masai.daoApp.DAOBean"/>
<bean id="db2" class="com.masai.daoApp.DAOBean"/>
<bean id="sb" class="com.masai.daoApp.ServiceBean" autowire="byType" />
<bean id="pb" class="com.masai.daoApp.PresentationBean" autowire="byType" />
constructor auto-wiring:
In this strategy , spring container uses constructor injection instead of setter injection.
dependency resolution is done by using max number of argument constructor, if constructors are overloaded.
Note:- it first uses byName and if not found then it uses byType , and in case byType is matched with
more that 1 then ambiguity exception will occur.
And if not matched ,here variable will not remain null, it will throw "UnsaticfiedDependencyException"
This kind of auto-wiring is least preferred because of constructor ambiguity. and circular dependency
example:
Spring Day1 20
A.java:
--------
package com.masai;
public class A {
public void funA() {
System.out.println("inside funA of A");
}
}
B.java:-
----------
package com.masai;
public class B {
public void funB() {
System.out.println("inside funB of B");
}
}
Demo.java:
------------
package com.masai;
public class Demo {
private A a1;
private A a2;
private B b1;
public Demo() {
System.out.println("inside zero argument constructor..");
}
public Demo(B b1, A a1) {
this.b1=b1;
this.a1=a1;
System.out.println("inside 2 argument constructor..");
}
public Demo(B b1, A a1,A a2) {
this.b1=b1;
this.a1=a1;
this.a2=a2;
System.out.println("inside 3 argument constructor..");
}
public void showDetails() {
System.out.println("inside showDetails....");
System.out.println("b1 is :"+b1);
System.out.println("a1 is :"+a1);
System.out.println("a2 is :"+a2);
}
}
Spring Day1 21
applicationContext.xml:-
<bean id="d1" class="com.masai.Demo" autowire="constructor" />
<bean id="a5" class="com.masai.A"/>
<bean id="a6" class="com.masai.A" />
<bean id="b5" class="com.masai.B" />
Main.java:
----------
package com.masai;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
//activate the spring container by locating the spring configuration file..
ApplicationContext ctx= new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");
Demo d= ctx.getBean("d1",Demo.class);
d.showDetails();
}
}
-here container will create the object of Demo class by executing zero argument constructor, because 3
argument and 2 argument constructor does not qualify for the dependencies (they generate ambiguity
exception A a1)
-if we change the id of any A class inside the spring configuration file as "a1" then 2nd argument
constructor will gets the priority (here 3rd argument constructor will raise the ambiguity exception at A a2).
-if we change the id of one A class as a1 and another A class as a2 then 3rd argument constructor will gets
the priority,
here B will follow byType and A a1 and A a2 will follow byName strategy.
