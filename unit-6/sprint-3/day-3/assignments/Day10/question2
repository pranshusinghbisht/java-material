Q2/- How many scopes are there for a Spring Bean, which is the default scope for a Spring
Bean? Explain with an example

Answer:



Bean scope:
A scope indicates the life span of an object of Spring bean.
Spring f/w defines 4 scopes for a bean:
1. singleton scope (it is a default scope of spring bean)
2. prototype scope
3. request scope
4. session scope
Note: request and session scopes are used only in the web-app (spring -mvc module)
singleton and prototype scope can be used in both web and non-web(standalone) application.
Singleton scope : it returns same bean class object for all the getBean() method call with the same bean id. i.e
whenever we are pulling an object with the same id multiple time ,container will return same object.
Example:
A obj1 = ctx.getBean("a1",A.class);
A obj2 = ctx.getBean("a1",A.class);
System.out.println(obj1 == obj2); //true
Note: If the same bean class is configured with different id then container creates one more object for that bean, it
means container makes a spring bean object as a singleton with respect to the id.
Prototype scope:
It returns a separate bean class object for every getBean() method call even with the same id also.
In order to tell the container to put a bean object in a prototype scope we need to mention by
using "scope" attribute of the <bean> tag.
Example:
Spring Day1 26
<bean id="a1" class="com.masai.A" scope="prototype">
<property name="message" value="Welcome to Spring.."/>
</bean>
ApplicationContext ctx= new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");
A obj1 = ctx.getBean("a1",A.class);
A obj2 = ctx.getBean("a1",A.class);
System.out.println(obj1 == obj2); //false
